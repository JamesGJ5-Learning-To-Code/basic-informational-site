# Suggestions from TOP:

1. Don't worry too much about the content of each page
2. node.js server file should be index.js
3. Add to index.js the code needed to serve the right page according to the url:
    1. localhost:8080 should take users to index.html
    2. localhost:8080/about should take users to about.html
    3. localhost:8080/contact-me should take users to contact-me.html
    4. 404.html should display any time the user tries to go to a page not listed above
